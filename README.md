# CSE 4/589: Programming Assignment 1 (PA1) AutoGrader
If you have landed at this repository directly, you first should read up on bit of a background [here](https://cse4589.github.io/).

## Introduction
PA1 autograder itself runs as a distributed server-client application, with the server instances setup and deployed (one-off operation) by the course staff and client side distributed to the students/Teaching Assistants (TAs), which they can use to test the submission and get a score.
The _Grader_ directory holds both the client and server components:

* _Grader/local_ hosts the client code
* _Grader/remote_ hosts the server code
